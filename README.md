# Forensic-Dentistry-Gender-Prediction

Objective: To predict gender based on certain tooth measurement

Background: Forensic medicine is an interesting area of study. Forensic dentistry is a branch of forensic medicine. During natural calamities or due to some other reasons, many times, it is not possible to find out the gender of the deceased person. In such cases, certain measurements of the tooth will be taken (as bones and teeth do not decay easily) and gender will be determined. This project is done on Indian population data.

Scope:
•	Identify data structure and variables.
•	Apply different classification techniques and try to find which is best.
•	Based on casts we must identify the Gender whether male or female.


Aim: Build a predictive model which can take the tooth measurements as input and give the gender of the person as output
